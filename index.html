I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling  - time of my life. since completing the course. I've <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at VR startup."</p>

            <p class="fourth-text">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the programm. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and i never had to wait long  for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> fact, I've often refferd to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> development experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack  <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
